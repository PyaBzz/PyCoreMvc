//Task: Based on the PluralSight course add logging to DbCtx to logg SQL commands to the console.
//Task: Break down the solution to "Data", "Domain" and "Webite/myCoreMvc" projects.

//FuturePlan: Further develop upon authorisation and authentication
//Experiment: Google Authentication using OIDC based on:
//https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=aspdotnet-core-fundamentals&author=scott-allen&name=aspdotnet-core-fundamentals-m7&clip=5&mode=live

//Task: Use Selenium to automate web GUI testing. Look into Katalon Studio as a full feature IDE.

//FuturePlan: OnBound and similar methods are in fact attributes declared in "Msharp.Framework.Mvc.Version\src\Attributes"
// See if you can use OnActionExecuting() and OnActionExecuted() or similar methods from these pages to achieve similar functionality:
// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controller.onactionexecuting?view=aspnetcore-2.1
// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/understanding-action-filters-cs

//Experience: Look into object mapping solutions like AutoMapper to learn best practices.
